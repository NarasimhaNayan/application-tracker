In the project's earlier version, users were restricted to static fields, limiting their ability to effectively manage and track applications using predefined column values. Moreover, all applications were displayed in a single list, making it challenging for users to efficiently organize and monitor their applications. To address these limitations, we've implemented several enhancements.

## Key Features and Improvements:

*1. Dynamic Board and Column Creation:*
   - Users can now create multiple boards, each representing different projects, jobs, or categories.
   - Within each board, users have the flexibility to dynamically create and manage columns that reflect various stages or categories relevant to the project.

*2. Column Customization:*
   - Users have the freedom to customize each column by assigning titles and descriptions.
   - They can define workflow stages, categories, or other pertinent information to cater to their specific use case.

*3. Update Tracking:*
   - Inside each column, users can add updates to monitor the progress and details of individual tasks, job applications, or project components.
   - Each update can include a title, description, and significant events associated with the particular task or job application.

*4. Stage Tracking:*
   - Users can designate a stage to each update, indicating its position in the workflow. This could be standard stages like "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed," or customized stages according to the user's preferences.

*5. Drag and Drop Functionality:*
   - To enhance the user experience and streamline board management, users can make use of drag and drop functionality to move updates from one column to another.
   - This feature simplifies the tracking of task progression, for example, moving a task from "To Do" to "In Progress" when work commences.

*6. Data Persistence:*
   - The application ensures that board configurations, columns, updates, and user data are securely stored in a database for long-term accessibility.

These enhancements provide users with a highly adaptable job tracker and project management system, enabling them to tailor boards, columns, and updates to align with their specific needs. The drag-and-drop feature and dynamic column creation significantly enhance the user experience, making the tracking of tasks and jobs more efficient and interactive.
